* Question 3
The contour probability for $H_{0}:\theta_{0}=0.25$ is obtained with
two computational approaches solving the same problem: measuring the
area under the beta posterior density curve with limits defined such
that $p(\theta|y) > p(\theta_{0}|y)$. When \theta_{0} is less than the
mode of the posterior density, this area corresponds to $P(\theta_{0}
< \theta < \delta)$, with density $p(\delta | y)=p(\theta_{0})$. In this
scenario, the complement $p_{b}$ of the probability $P(\theta_{0} <
\theta < \delta)$ can be interpreted as the counterpart of a two-sided
p-value. This is the contour probability.

# First approaches are briefly defined
In the first approach, we simply look for $\delta$ such that
$(P(\theta_0|y) - P(\delta|y))^2=0$. This is accomplished with the
numerical optimization *R* program /optimize/. Again assuming
$\theta_{0}$ to be the lower limit of integration, the complement of
$p_{b}$ is then obtained from:

#+name: eq_q3int
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
P(\theta_{0} < \theta < \delta) =& \int_{\theta_{0}}^{\delta}
P(\theta | y) d\theta \\
=&\int_{\theta_{0}}^{\delta}\frac{1}
{\operatorname{Beta}(\bar{\alpha}, \bar{\beta})} \theta^{\bar{\alpha}-1} 
(1 - \theta)^{\bar{\beta} - 1} \\
=& F(\delta | y) - F(\theta_{0} | y)
\end{split}
\end{align}

with the *R* digital table for the beta cumulative distribution
$F$. In the second approach, we first obtain the mode $\bar{\theta}$
of the posterior beta density with
$\frac{\bar{\alpha}-1}{\bar{\alpha} + \bar{\beta}-2}$. Then, for the
case where $\theta_{0}$ is less than $\bar{\theta}$, we search for
$\delta$ in the interval $[\bar{\theta}, 1]$ such that $P(\theta_{0} |
y)=P(\delta | y)$. This is accomplished with the *R* program
/uniroot/. Once $\delta$ is obtained, the complement of the contour
probability $p_{b}$ is measured by following Equation [[eq_q3int]]. Both
approaches give return the same contour probabilities.

As in Questions 2 and 3, we give dose 0 an informative conjugate prior
with $\alpha=y-1=29$ and $\beta=n-y-1=193$. The other doses are given
vague beta priors with $\alpha=1$ and $\beta=1$ which correspond to a
uniform distribution with support from 0 to 1. In Table [[tab_contours]],
the contour probabilities are presented for each dose. The probability
at dose 500 couldn't converge because 1 is the maximum of the beta
distribution and the posterior mode as a value of 1. Convergence could
have be obtained with an informative prior. For every dose, the
probability of the true $\theta$ being 0.25 is less than 0.05. Thus,
we conclude that the $H_0$ is implausible and reject it. Remarkably
with dose 0, we would have kept $H_{0}$ had the prior been
non-informative (i.e. $p_b=0.68$).

In Figure [[fig_contourplots]], the complement of the contour probabilities are
illustrated for each dosage. These are coloured in grey and the
plotted curves are the posterior beta distributions.

* Question 10
Our goal here is to find the dosage associated with an increase of
0.01 in excess risk $q$ of foetus malformation. It is useful to
reformulate the question in order to clarify the problem and its
solution.

 The excess risk $q$ is associated with a probability of malformation
$P(d^{*})$ by:

\begin{equation}
P(d^{*})=q(1-P(0)) + P(0)
\end{equation}

where $P(0)$ is the prevalence of foetus malformation at a dose 0 of
diglyme. The logit of $P(d)$, the probability of malformation at a
given dose, can be estimated with the linear model $\alpha + \beta*
\mathrm{dose}$. As such, the dose we are looking for can be deduced
with simple algebra from

#+name: eq_q10dose
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{dose}=\mathrm{BMD}=\frac{\operatorname{logit}(P(d^{*})) 
- \alpha}{\beta}
\end{equation}

provided we have estimates for $\alpha$ and $\beta$. This dose is
called the benchmark dose (BMD). From Question 3, we posess samples
from the posterior distributions of $\beta$ and $\alpha$. Thus, we can
not only furnish a point estimate of the BMD, but also express its
uncertainty with a certitude interval. Only, as the dose variable is
standardized, Equation [[eq_q10dose]] becomes

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{BMD}=\left(\frac{\operatorname{logit}(P(d^{*})) - \alpha}
{\beta}\right) s_{\mathrm{dose}} + \operatorname{avg}(\mathrm{dose})
\end{equation}

where $s$ and $\operatorname{avg}$ respectively designate the standard
deviation and mean of the dose covariate.

Assuming that the prevalence at dose 0, $P(0)$, is known and obtained
from the proportion in the provided table (i.e. 0.238), we get a mean
BMD of 32.17 with a $95\%$ equal-tails certitude interval of 20.53 to
42.79.
